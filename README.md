<strong>Of course there is an option to create more categories, and it's easily done. Just go to the *ticketBot.js* file. Once there, head to line *102*. There is the select menu displayed showing the 3 pre-existing categories. To add one, copy the third category and simply change "CATEGORY_NAMES.category3" to "CATEGORY_NAMES.category4". Once that is done, head to the *tickets_config.json* file and create a "category4" line with information where needed.</strong>
